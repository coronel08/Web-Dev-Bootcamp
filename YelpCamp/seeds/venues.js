It's one of the most popular venues around Los Angeles, mainly due to it being all ages and cheap. My favorite show here was probably the FYF Fest pre-show in 2011 with Title Fight and Touche Amore. Conveniently located next to Nuevo Jalisco, a dive bar that puts on drag shows during the weekends.",

Old rosters for this venue would regularly include artists such as Green Day, Rancid, AFI, and many others. A staple for anyone interested in punk music and the DIY music scene. I have personally never been inside, but included it because on our first visit to the bay area we had the option of catching Limp Wrist here but didn’t. Still kind of bummed I missed hardcore punk icons Limp Wrist, they tour pretty infrequently.",

I remember being so exhausted I could barely enjoy Oso Oso’s set, Best Band and Best Dude. We finished off our trip with a visit to a waffle house where the chef dropped an egg and decided to take a smoke break after we placed our orders. We only waited 15 mins extra for our food but I waited a lifetime to try those Smothered and Covered Hash Browns.",
